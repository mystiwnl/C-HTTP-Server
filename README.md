## Updates
```sh
0.2/ Added multi-threading to handel multiple connections and the ability to find any file that exists, not only the one in the code.


```

## Usage

```sh
Tested with curl and wget
```

## Run tests

```sh
wget localhost:1441, curl localhost:1441, or with a specific html file request, it also handles a not found 404 response
nc localhost:1441 , GET /hello.html(Also works with any other file, if it exists) HTTP/1.1
```
